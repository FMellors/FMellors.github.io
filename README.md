Content
I have included the necessary content requirements to the best of my ability.  The functional content form also has a drop down menu for my contact numbers. (I tried numerous ways to get it to open up as a new email link but couldn't get it to work).  I included a link to the She Codes external site and as we complete more projects, I will make the "view" buttons under each image link to the example.
[Y] At least one profile picture
[Y] Biography (at least 100 words)

Technical
My three pages link to both external pages and ones within the site.  I was happy with my responsive design principles except for the footer - again, just couldn't get it move with the page.
